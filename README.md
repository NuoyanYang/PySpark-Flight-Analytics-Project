# PySpark-Flight-Analytics-Project
A Data-Intensive Distributed Computing Project. Constructed and visualized a flight network graph using Spark GraphFrames to conduct data analysis on the relationships within the flight data such as finding the busiest airport (PageRank) and the most important route. Predicted the delay of flights with machine learning models including Logistics Regression, Na\"ive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest with the top accuracy around 84\%, precision around 90\%, and F1-score around 79\%.
